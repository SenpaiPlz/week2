# Clone of hgop/week2 repository
### Why a clone instead of a fork?
Well as it turns out, I decided to clone the repo and make some changes before reading the line "Fork week2" in the assignment.
To ammend this as well as I could, I added the hgop/week2 as a remote upstream, to ease pulling and requesting pull requests to the original repo.
